# **Blast**

**This complete workflow shows how complex tasks can be assembled within Grid Engine.**
## The Task breakdown is as follows: 

1. Stage in some data from the bulk storage (DataStore).
 
2. Preprocess the data (split it up into pieces)
 
3. Perform some embarrassingly parallel calculations on the data (in an array job)
 
4. Reduce the data
 
5. Stage results back to DataStore
 
6. Cleanup of the temporary data.
